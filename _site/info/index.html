  <h2 id="how-much-does-a-frame-and-fork-cost%3F" tabindex="-1">How much does a frame and fork cost?</h2>
<p>All fillet-brazed steel frames start at <strong>$1899</strong>.</p>
<p>This includes two sets of mounting points for water bottles, stops/guides for brake and derailleur lines, ISO disc brake mounting, 12mm thru axle dropouts, and a single color powder coat with contrasting graphics.</p>
<p>Extra options are available and included in the order form I'll send you after you make your deposit.</p>
<p>All custom steel forks start at <strong>$599</strong>.</p>
<p>This includes either a lugged crown or segmented style fork with ISO disc brake mounting and thru axle dropouts. I currently don't offer a steel fork for flat mount brakes. For that you can choose among a variety of carbon forks.</p>
<h2 id="what's-the-ordering-process%3F" tabindex="-1">What's the ordering process?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If after our initial conversation, you’d like to have a Manzanita in your life, you’ll pay a non-refundable <strong>$500 deposit</strong>. You’ve now committed to the build, and I’ll add you to the build schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once added to the schedule, it’s time for some homework. You’ll receive an order form to record your body and bike measurements and to list the components you'd like to use for the build. This information will help me design your bike for the proper clearances and the right fit. It's at this point that you'll want to consider getting a professional fit. That way we can be confident that the contact points—hands, butt, feet—are where they should be to provide a comfortable and efficient ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At your scheduled build time, we’ll discuss all of the details that will make your bike unique. We’ll talk ride characteristics, geometry, riding style, frame options, paint colors, fit, and component selection. Soon after, I’ll provide a CAD drawing of your frame and a detailed quote for the frame and components. We can go back and forth at this point until everything meets your expectations. After approving the design, you’ll pay 50% of the balance for the frame and components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the frame is finished and built into a complete machine, you’ll pay the remaining balance. Your new ride will then be partially dismantled and carefully wrapped in protective packing material and sent to you fully insured. It’s a good idea to bring your new bike to your favorite professional bike mechanic for final assembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hop on your new Manzanita and pedal!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-tubing-brands-do-you-use%3F" tabindex="-1">What tubing brands do you use?</h2>
<p>Your frame may include tubes from Reynolds, Columbus, Dedacciai, Kaisei, and other high-quality manufacturers. At this time, there is no reliable source of tubes made in the USA.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-warranty%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the warranty?</h2>
<p>I use only the best tubing and raw materials for making your frame, and I stand by my work. If you are the original owner, Manzanita Cycles offers a lifetime warranty on all Manzanita-made products that fail due to a materials or manufacturing defect.</p>
<p>If you crash, abuse, modify, or damage your Manzanita product, or if you install parts incorrectly, use incompatible parts, or fail to do proper maintenance on your bike, then it will no longer be covered by the warranty. Any paint and graphics are also not covered.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with a component not made by Manzanita Cycles, it's best to contact the component manufacturer for support. However, if you're having trouble getting traction, let me know and I'll try to help out.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-turnaround-time%3F" tabindex="-1">What is your turnaround time?</h2>
<p>I will provide you an estimated turnaround time during our first discussion. Although I try to keep an inventory of commonly-used raw materials, the Global Pandemic has affected the entire supply chain. It really depends on whether all of the materials and components are available at the time when you place your deposit and how complicated your paint scheme is. A simple powder coat can knock off an extra month or more of waiting compared to a fancier paint job.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-only-sell-complete-bikes%3F" tabindex="-1">Do you only sell complete bikes?</h2>
<p>Although I prefer to build your bike as a complete unit in order to guarantee that it looks and performs its best, I’m also happy to send you the frame for your favorite professional bike mechanic to build up. I don’t charge a build fee if you get a majority of the components through Manzanita Cycles. And I offer special pricing on the components for a full or almost full build.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-build-custom-wheels%2C-racks%2C-or-stems%3F" tabindex="-1">Do you build custom wheels, racks, or stems?</h2>
<p>No. I prefer to focus on making you the best frame and fork possible. There are several great professional wheel builders I can recommend. Tubus and Nitto make the best touring and randonneuring racks. I regularly use those racks to optimally place rack mounts. And there’s no advantage I feel to a custom steel stem. We can always paint your stem to match the frame if you want that fully integrated look.</p>
<h2 id="is-shipping-included-in-the-price%3F" tabindex="-1">Is shipping included in the price?</h2>
<p>No. I use BikeFlights or ShipBikes to ship your bike with insurance to cover its replacement in case of theft or damage. Shipping to a US destination starts at $100 for a frame set and $150 for a complete bike. International destinations will be more. Contact me for a quote.</p>

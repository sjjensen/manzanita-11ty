  <h3 id="why-buy-a-bike-from-manzanita%3F" tabindex="-1">Why buy a bike from Manzanita?</h3>
<p>I have years of experience bicycle touring, bikepacking, and taking my bikes on adventures. It’s important for the bike to fit well when you’re in the saddle all day, multiple days in a row. I also understand how luggage affects a bike’s personality. Based on how you like carrying your stuff, I can make sure the bicycle handles predictably. When you’re confident and comfortable on your bike, you can relax your body. This conserves energy, prevents accidents, and makes the bike a joy to ride.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-building-frames%3F" tabindex="-1">How long have you been building frames?</h3>
<p>In 2007 I attended a class in Niles, Michigan, run by Doug Fattic. In the class I learned to silver braze a classic lugged touring frame and fork. I took that bike on a number of tours, including a <a href="http://rideeatcamp.com/category/iceland/">roll around Iceland in 2008</a>. Now my brother-in-law uses it for commuting and day rides. It’s great to see the bike still doing its job.</p>
<p>Then in 2014 I attended Dave Bohm’s framebuilding class in Tuscon, AZ, to focus on learning how to fillet braze. Fillet brazing is a lot of work. Some would say even tedious. But I love to look at a freshly filed fillet, the smooth, organic arc that attaches the tubes together. It’s what keeps me from switching to TIG welding.</p>
<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-your-favorite-type-of-frame-to-build%3F" tabindex="-1">What’s your favorite type of frame to build?</h3>
<p>My interest in framebuilding started with making touring bikes. They’re practical and versatile. They can also be complicated. You have to account for fenders, wide tires, racks, dynamo lighting, and you really want to get the fit just right. Tourists and randonneurs spend long days in the saddle, and they rely on their bikes to get them to their destination without any trouble. I love the challenge of incorporating these ideas into a complete bicycle. It’s really rewarding.</p>
<p>But these days I spend most of my riding time off road. Mountain bike geometry and components have evolved so much in the past few years. As someone who loves to geek out on frame geometry, there’s no better playground right now than the mountain bike. The hardtail I’m building these days is really a blast to ride. It’s fun to jump. It’s playful. And it handles rocky and loose terrain really well.</p>
<p>So I guess it’s safe to say that I don’t have a favorite. I’m currently building all-road and hardtail frames because those are the kinds of bikes I ride most often.</p>
<h3 id="why-call-your-company-manzanita%3F" tabindex="-1">Why call your company Manzanita?</h3>
<p>Manzanita is the common name for the plant <em>Arctostaphylos</em>. It grows all over the western United States. To me the Manzanita is a symbol of the West. It thrives in harsh conditions but it also has a certain grace to it. It’s rugged and beautiful. I think those are two good adjectives to describe the best bikes.</p>

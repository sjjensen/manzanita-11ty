Chip is a magician on the bike. It’s almost a lie to say that I’ve ridden with him several times because as soon as the trail points downhill he disappears.

![Manzanita hardcore hardtail frame](../../uploads/Chip-overall.jpeg)Chip asked me to build him a 29er hardtail that would thrive on the rowdy trails in the Santa Cruz mountains. He was looking for a frame suited to his lanky 6’4″ body that would be playful yet aggressive enough to handle the more technical challenges the Santa Cruz trails throw at you. He wanted to use a 140 mm travel fork, Boost spacing in the rear, a 1x drivetrain, and a 150 mm travel dropper post—all standard requests for a hardtail these days.

With those design constraints set, combined with some body and current bike measurements, I designed what I feel to be a good representation of the all-mountain hardtail. The front end isn’t crazy long, like you’ll see on some of the latest downhill hardtails. The chainstays are also kept on the short side because Chip likes to hop over, off, and around stuff while cruising at warp speeds.
